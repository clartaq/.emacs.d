This is just a set of simple emacs configuration files that I use for programming and writing.

This will change often, since I am still learning. Don't put too much stock in
it since my emacs-fu is quite weak.

Inspiration for this configuration came from a few sources:

- Hiep Pham's (hiephh) dot file repository [here](https://github.com/hiepph/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs/.emacs.d).
- Oleksandr Manenko's "[How to Set Up Emacs for Rust Development](https://manenko.com/2016/08/03/setup-emacs-for-rust-development.html)"
- Patrick Thomson's (patrickt) repository and thorough explanation [here](https://github.com/patrickt/emacs).
